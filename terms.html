    <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
    FREE DOWNLOADS – Free Downloads are NO FREE BEATS. Only non-commercial / non-profitable use. The purpose of free downloads 
    is to offer the possibility to record / write a song to them and have a test-drive to see if the final results are worth 
    it investing in a license. The free downloads contain tags and these tags may not be removed under any circumstances.<br>
</li><li>
    LEASING RIGHTS – Also known as non-exclusive rights, purchasing a lease grants the customer limited artistic &amp; 
    legislative rights to the corresponding beat(s) for one single profitable/commercial use of the track already 
    synchronized (with vocal audios) on any medium (e.g. album, EP or mixtape) with a circulation of up to 2.500 sales 
    unites. If this point of sale is reached &amp; further sales are desired, also further rights with a new sales cap need 
    to be obtained (if the beat has not yet been sold with exclusive rights &amp; is still available). If the beat is no more 
    available for leasing, no more sales can be made after the sales cap is reached. A lease comes as a mixed tag-free 
    MP3-file, WAV-file &amp; a contract/invoice, stating the rights of use. A beat can be leased to more than one person at the 
    same time until exclusive rights are sold to the beat. Once a beat has been sold with exclusive rights, it will no 
    longer be available for any kind of leasing. Previous leasing rights that have been sold before are not affected &amp; stay 
    valid until the sales cap has been reached. Leasing a beat does not make the customer the sole owner of the beat. 
    The licensee is not allowed to get profitable radio-, video or television-airplay or to perform the song on commercial/
    profitable shows with a leasing license. For this purpose licensee must own exclusive rights to the beat. The licensor 
    expressly forbids re-sale or any other distribution of the producer’s compositions, either as they exist or any modificat
    ion thereof. You (the customer) cannot sell, loan, rent, lease, assign, remix, rearrange, remove any melodies, instruments, 
    drum programming or transfer all or any of the products sold or the corresponding rights to another person (example – 
    Record Label, another production company, another producer, another artist), or for use in any competitive product. 
    The licensee understands that the licensor maintains 100% copyright &amp; ownership of the original instrumental 
    composition. Licensee cannot use any beat compositions as background element in TV, Film &amp; DVD / computer game 
    projects without obtaining written consent &amp; a separate license agreement. Licensee must include on all productions &amp; 
    products the producer’s name. Licensee agrees to display the producer’s name in all physical media or within 
    web presentation of a portion (e.g. pre-listening) or sum of the original instrumental composition that is being 
    licensed in this agreement. Including but not limited to CD’s, CD covers, Cassette tapes, LP’s, Cards, Youtube 
    titles, Soundcloud, etc. (Example credits: ‘Beat prod. by Upright Beats’ or ‘Music prod. by Upright Beats’ … 
    Music © 2018 All rights reserved. Used under license. Any displayed or downloadable MP3 files must include 
    ‘produced by Upright Beats’ within the file name. Furthermore, LEASING RIGHTS are subject to registrations in points 
    (6) – (9).<br>
</li><li>
    PREMIUM LEASING RIGHTS – Same restrictions as in point (2) including the following differences: A premium lease 
    comes as a mixed tag-free MP3-file &amp; WAV-file, the corresponding separate track-lines &amp; a contract/invoice, 
    stating the rights of use. Instead of an allowed circulation of up to 2.500 sales units, the premium 
    lease allows up to 10.000 sales units. In addition, the customer is allowed to use the beat for 1 profitable 
    public performance with up to $2.500 USD earnings in total of the performance. The Licensor hereby grants limited 
    synchronization rights for One (1) music video streamed online (Youtube, Vimeo, etc..) for up to 1000000 
    non-monetized video streams on all total sites. A separate synchronization license will need to be purchased 
    for distribution of video to Television, Film or Video game. If the beat is no longer available and offered for 
    any form of licensing and/or marked as sold, license owners of any type of non-exclusive rights may upgrade their 
    current license to the highest available non-exclusive license such as a unlimited pro lease. If exclusive rights are 
    no longer available, this does not affect license owners from being allowed to upgrade their non-exclusive license(s) 
    to the highest form of non-exclusive license(s). Once Licensee has reached the allowed number of sales and any other 
    limits concerning his license agreement, no more sales can be made after the sales cap is reached. Licensee expressly 
    agrees to remove his song from any marketplaces, stores, etc. to avoid the song from being sold or monetized continuously. 
    All other terms concerning premium leasing rights are listed in point (2). Furthermore, PREMIUM LEASING RIGHTS are subject 
    to registrations in points (6) – (9).<br>
</li><li>

    but including the following differences: The purchase of unlimited leasing rights grants the customer non-exclusive 
    artistic and commercial rights to the purchased beat. There is no sales cap (earning-limit) related to unlimited 
    leasing rights, other than the license being valid for 8 years. After license has expired, licensee has option to 
    renew his license by purchasing a new unlimited leasing rights license for another 8 years, a different non-exclusive 
    license (down-grade) or upgrade to exclusive rights (if still available). This renewal-, downgrade-, or upgrade-option 
    for licensee stays unaffected by any exclusive rights sale (even if exclusive rights are no longer available, 
    licensee can still renew his non-exclusive license). An unlimited leasing rights purchase comes as a mixed tag-free 
    WAV-file, a mixed MP3-file and the corresponding separate in WAV-format (also known as tracked outs) along with a 
    license agreement/receipt, stating the rights of use and details of purchase. Licensee is allowed to sell his song over 
    the beat-composition without any sales limitation or sales cap, worldwide and throughout the universe, with a 
    terminability of 8 years after date of purchase, in any commercial/profitable form, and/or transfer the rights 
    to his song over the beat, to another party such as Record Labels, another production company and another artist, 
    but never the rights to the beat-composition itself for a standalone beat-composition product. Licensee may distribute 
    his songs in digital or physical form, as singles, EPs, LPs, soundtracks, etc., generate unlimited unit-based sales 
    or collect pay-outs (unlimited earnings) via streaming based services/plaforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and 
    others, without any limit of profits. Licensee may use songs and genreate unlimited earnings through live-shows,

    forbids re-sale or other distribution of the producer’s beat-composition standalone, either as they exist or any 
    modifications thereof for use in any competitive product, nor can licensee transfer his rights to the beat-composition 
    to a third party if it’s not a full song with artist’s/licensee’s own vocals or at least lyrics. The 
    licensee understands that the licensor maintains 100% copyright and ownership of the original instrumental composition 
    and that licensee buys unlimited sales rights and rights of use to the beat-composition(s) but not the intellectual 
    property itself. This is necessary and entitles licensor to maintain the administrative and legislative rights to 
    the beat-composition, in order to be able to ensure non-exclusive license owners administrative guidance and 
    license-warranties. Licensee must include on all productions, products and any medium the producer’s name (Upright Beats) 
    or website (http://www.uprightbeats.com). Licensee agrees to display the producer’s name in all physical media or

    licensed in this agreement. Including but not limited to CD’s, CD covers, Booklets, Cassette tapes, LP’s, Cards, Cases, 
    Boxes, etc. (Example credits: ‘Beat prod. by Upright Beats (Dmitry Likhachev)’ or ‘Music or Beat produced by Upright Beats 
    (uprightbeats.com)’ … Music © 2018 All rights reserved. Used under license. Any displayed or downloadable files such as 
    MP3-files must include ‘Beat by Upright Beats’ within the file name. Furthermore, UNLIMITED LEASING RIGHTS are 
    subject to registrations in point (6) – point (9).<br>
</li><li>

    purchased beat. There is no sales cap related to exclusive rights. An exclusive rights purchase comes as a mixed 
    tag-free WAV-file, the corresponding separate track-lines &amp; contract/invoice stating the rights of use. Once a beat 
    has been sold with exclusive rights, it will no longer be available for any kind of leasing/sale. Previous leasing 
    rights being sold before the beat has been sold exclusively are not affected hereby &amp; stay valid until the sales cap 
    has been reached. It is therefore possible that a beat has been leased several times before exclusive rights are sold.
