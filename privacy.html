    <h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

            Uprightbeats.com is committed to protecting your privacy online. We are also committed to providing you 
            with the very best experience we can on our Web site. In order to enhance your experience at our site we gather 
            certain personal information about you that helps us customize our content to your tastes and preferences. 
            Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full 
            use of our Web site. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.
            <h5>What information do we collect?</h5>
            
            Uprightbeats.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our Web site.
            <br>
            Uprightbeats.com collects some personal information when you initially sign up for some of our free services. 
            We may ask for your name, e-mail address, zip code, and country. The more information you share with us 
            (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to enhance and customize your experience on our site.
            <br>
            In addition to the former information, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including 
            (but not limited to) when you make a purchase through our online store, when you enter promotions or 
            contests and when you respond to a survey. For example, when you make a purchase through our online store, 
            we collect several items of personal information, including your billing and shipping address, telephone 
            number, credit card information, and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. For your 
            security, we never store credit card information on our servers. We transmit credit card information 
            directly to the third party credit card processor through secure connections.
            <br>
            Wherever Uprightbeats.com collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this 
            <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> on that page.
            
            <h5>What information do parties other than Uprightbeats.com collect?</h5>

            <br>

            In addition, when you make a purchase through our online store, or sign up to receive promotional items from 
            us, we may share some of your personal information with third parties helping us to complete your transaction

            will work to ensure that only the information necessary to complete your transaction is disclosed.
            <br>

        <h5>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h5>
            
            From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy. We will post those changes on this page 
            so that our customers will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, 
            and under what circumstances we share the information with others.
